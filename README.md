## Synopsis and Motivation

This brief project is submitted to Holiday Extras. It is a tech test completed by Shane Oston Stowe. The application calls a Flickr API that "grabs" a random sample of public flickr photos and displays the details of the posted photo.

## Installation

* Fork or clone the project
* Run ```npm install```
* Run ```npm start```

## Reference

The application is written in Angular 2, rc 1.  It has a simple implementation of a single component that calls the Flickr public API via JSONP and applies the data to the view template.
